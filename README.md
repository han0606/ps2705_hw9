# This is a remote repository for Assignment 9.

The purpose of this remote repository is to present my outcome of assignment 9 in PS2705. Once you clone this repository and run `Makefile`, you will find `output.yaml`
which contains all the important information about the text files listed in the document folder. The python file, `SentenceParse.py`, contains all the functions that generate the relevant information about the text files.
